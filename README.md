# Introduction

This example demonstrate how we can utilize the following

:heavy_check_mark: Inversion of Control : Service Locator pattern

:heavy_check_mark: Simple Factory PRogramming idiom

:heavy_check_mark: Interface Segregation Principle = Many specific interfaces are better than a single, general interface.

:heavy_check_mark: Open Closed Principle (OCP) = Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

:heavy_check_mark: Dependency Inversion Principle =  Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.

:heavy_check_mark: [ServiceLoader API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html)

:heavy_check_mark: [Java Dynamic Proxies](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/Proxy.html)

:heavy_check_mark: Json processor

### To Acheive An Appication Which Is

:star2: Modular

:star2: Loosely Coupled

:star2: Highly Configurable

:star2: Highly Testable

:star2: Event Based

### Running the example
Just run the class in console-demo module

```
java com.prokarma.app.Main
```
